==============
== FOREWORD ==
==============
  Before you take one step further, fair warning.  This isn't finished yet.
This document is out here now only because of the sheer amount of data
already compiled that was really needed now and not later when everything is
finished.  As such, you will not find much about damage and actual ability
mechanics yet, since those sections are not complete yet.  They shall come in
time.

  This is very much a work in progress, but I'm pleased to say that much has
already been deciphered to the point where much of what's left is just typing
things up and testing out obscure cases.  However, these things take time,
and there is still a lot to test.

  Please note: the main purpose of this update was to get some things I'd
half worked on in the last few months out into the guide, so that people can
make use of them.  However, this was done mostly so that I could concentrate
on other things for the next few months, so expect no further work on this
for the recent future.  I'll pick it back up again in a few months time,
after I've finished some other outstanding projects.

  Til next time.

== DEFINITIONS ==
=================
  Before we get into the specifics of FFTA, some notation must be defined.

FFTA Definitions
================
  Our standard abbreviations and stat definitions to help make life easier:

    HP:    Hit Points - How much damage a unit can take before they are KOed
    MP:    Magic Points - How much mystical energy they have to use for
             certain attacks
    WAtk:  Weapon Atk - The physical attack power of a unit
    WDef:  Weapon Def - Defense against physical attacks
    MPow:  Magic Pow - The magical attack power of a unit
    MRes:  Magic Res - Defense against magical attacks
    Speed: A measure of how often a unit can take a turn

    Mov:   Move - How far a unit can move on its turn
    Jmp:   Jump - How far a unit can jump vertically in safety
    Evade: How well a unit can avoid offensive attacks
    SRes:  Status Resist - How well a unit can resist status attacks

    JP:    Judge Points - Reward for following recommded laws and KOing
             units, and can be spent on Combos and Totema


    Primary Weapon: Important with Double Sword.  This is the weapon you will
                      attack with first, and will be the one you use for all
                      abilities that do not use the second weapon.  Your
                      Primary Weapon is the one with the most Weapon Atk.

    EqAtk: Equipment Attack - We'll be using this term a bit without too much
             warning, so it should be well defined.  This is the total bonus
             to Weapon Atk you have from your current equipment, excluding
             your Secondary Weapon if you're using Do
